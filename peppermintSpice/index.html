            <li><b>Languages:</b> This is a talent she has inherited from her maternal grandfather, Paprika Spice.

            <li><b>Hacking:</b> With a strong understanding with computers and math, Peppermint has proven to be an excellent hacker. Under a number of online aliases, she has proven to be a phantom within the cyberworld. Good thing she's not a troll, hehehe.</li>

    <section id="Relationships">
        <h2>Relationships</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Thyme Spice (Father/Deceased):</b> During her childhood, Peppermint was quite estranged from her father. She definitely inherited some traits from Thyme, but she wasn't very close to him, almost treating him like a stranger. As she grew older and Thyme passed away from heart attack, Peppermint was indifferent and realized that she got no closure with him. This manifested in the introverted and shut-in personality that Peppermint displays around new people.</li>
            <li><b>Lemon Spice (Mother):</b> Peppermint is very close to her mother, more so than Pumpkin and Cocoa. Sharing more of her mother's traits as well as likes and dislikes, Peppermint and Lemon have shown to be nearly as thick as thieves. Peppermint always discusses her problems with Lemon and Lemon offers her best advice she could. Peppermint is always thankful to have a mother like Lemon.</li>
            <li><b>Pumpkin Spice (Twin Sister):</b> Pumpkin and Peppermint share a very close sibling connection. During their childhood, the twins shared everything, such as toys, food, snacks and even playtime. But as they grew older, their different personalities made them easy to tell which twin is which, they didn't mind though. Despite their differences, Peppermint will always be by her sister's side when she needs her.</li>
            <li><b>Cocoa Spice (Younger Brother):</b> Cocoa has shown to be the true annoying little brother to Peppermin and Pumpkin. However he does show to have a good heart with a love of dinosaurs and race cars. Cocoa won't admit it, but he admires Peppermint's understanding and intelligent personality, to the point that he asks her good questions twice a week and asks her to help with his homework. Peppermint and Cocoa have a close relationship.</li>
            <li><b>Bay Leaf Spice (Cousin):</b> Bay Leaf, as a member of the Bees, hates how Pumpkin and Peppermint are more comfortable at school while she struggles to fit in. Peppermint tries to reason with Bay Leaf and tell her that being an Inkwell Creature is nothing to be ashamed of. Unfortunately, Bay Leaf thinks that Peppermint is lying and playing games with her mind. She gets this stubborn behavior from her uncle...</li>
            <li><b>Jessie McIntyre:</b> Joshua Edward McIntyre, or better known as Jessie, is Peppermint and Pumpkin's best friend from school. Despite her situation, Jessie adores Peppermint and Pumpkin's company and their enthusiasm for her gender identity. Jessie won't admit this, but she has a small crush on Peppermint and admires her skills and talents with computers, science and math.</li>
